# ScribblesOfMadness
 Bits and pieces from my work on Scribbles of Madness

For more information on the game take a look at its page on my [portfolio](http://www.christianfedrau.com/?p=23).

This game was made during my time in the [2 Games a Month incubator program](https://www.daestudios.be/incubator-two-games-a-month/).

If you have any questions about the code, feel free to reach out to me.
